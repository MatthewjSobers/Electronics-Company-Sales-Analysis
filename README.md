Electronics Store Sales Data Analysis
This project explores sales data from an electronics store, aiming to uncover key factors influencing the company's sales. The workflow includes data cleaning, analysis, SQL queries, and visualization in Power BI to present findings.

Project Workflow
1. Data Import and Cleaning
The dataset was imported into Oracle SQL for preprocessing. The data contains various fields like CUSTOMER_ID, AGE, PRODUCT_ID, TOTAL_PRICE, ORDER_STATUS, PAYMENT_METHOD, and more.
Key steps in the cleaning process:
Handled missing values.
Corrected data types for numerical and date fields.
Ensured consistent format across relevant columns.
2. SQL Analysis
Several SQL queries were developed to answer critical business questions, such as:
What are the top-selling products?
What are the demographic trends (age, gender) among the customers?
Which payment methods are preferred by customers?
What factors influence the total sales (loyalty membership, shipping type, product categories)?
Views were created in SQL to simplify data transfer and visualization in Power BI.
3. Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the insights drawn from SQL analysis, displaying key metrics like:
Sales by product category.
Sales trends over time.
The relationship between customer demographics and sales.
Sales breakdown by payment method and shipping type.
Key Findings
The analysis revealed several factors that influence the company's sales:

Product types and loyalty membership are strong predictors of high sales.
Age groups between 25-40 are the most frequent purchasers.
Shipping type and payment method also impact overall sales, with express shipping and digital payment methods contributing significantly.
Tools Used
SQL (Oracle SQL Developer): Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
